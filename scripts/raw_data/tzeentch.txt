'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[race]] introduced in [[Total War: Warhammer III]]. Tzeentch is the [[Chaos]] God of ambition, schemes, lies, magic and change. 

== How They Play==
*Grimoires
*Changing of the Ways
*Tzeentch Corruption, Unholy Manifestations and the Great Game
*Cults of Tzeentch
*Winds of Magic Manipulation
*Teleportation Stance
*'''Unit roster''': Tzeentch is a race that excels at spellcasting, missile firepower and flying units. Its units are protected by a magical barrier that absorbs damage and is replenished when not taking damage.

== Background ==
Tzeentch – the Changer of the Ways – is the Chaos God of magic, evolution, manipulation and trickery. He is flux incarnate – the God who truly embodies the endless, broiling change that is Chaos. It is Tzeentch above all who holds the terrible knowledge of fate and destiny in his talons. His worshippers are desperate to share in such lore but are merely pawns in the Great Game; another piece to move on the board and outplay the other Chaos Gods.

To serve Tzeentch is to invite insanity. His servants weave their own complex webs of influence and manipulation, founding cults in high society as well as armed legions of puppet-followers. They pay no mind to the fact that their master views such plots as mere petty distractions, for the Architect of Fate's own design is aeons in the making.

== Factions ==
Tzeentch factions are normal, non-[[horde]] factions who occupy settlements and control [[provinces]].

=== Playable factions ===
At the moment there are two playable Tzeentch factions, each led by a Legendary Lord. See individual pages for faction-specific info:
*'''{{Oracles of Tzeentch faction}}''', led by [[Kairos Fateweaver]].
*'''{{The Deceivers faction}}''', led by [[The Changeling]].

=== Minor factions===
<u>Total War: Warhammer III</u>

Factions introduced in [[The Lost God]] campaign:
*{{Apostles of Change faction}}
*{{Sarthorael's Watchers faction}}, led by [[Sarthorael the Everwatcher]].
*{{The Sightless faction}}

Factions introduced in [[The Realm of Chaos]] campaign:
*{{All-Seeing Eye faction}}
*{{Broken Wheel faction}}
*{{Flaming Scribes faction}}
*{{Tzeentch Rebels faction}}

Factions introduced in the [[Immortal Empires]] campaign:
*{{Tzeentchian Cult faction}} <small>(only appear in a Wood Elves campaign)</small>

== In Battle ==
=== General ===
Casting spells generates favour from Tzeentch that can be used on the following army abilities:

*[[File:Wh3 main army abilities arcane surge.png|38px]] [[Arcane Surge]]
*[[File:Wh3 main army abilities bolt of change.png|38px]] [[Bolt of Change]]
*[[File:Wh3 main army abilities storm of fire.png|38px]] [[Storm of Fire]]

=== Units ===
{{Main|Tzeentch unit roster}}

The Tzeentch army has access to daemonic and mortal units. All units have barrier and [[magical attacks]].

=== [[File:Bullet icon empire magic colleges.png]] Magic ===
Tzeentch spellcasters have access to 3 lores of magic:

*[[File:Icon wh main lore fire.png|38px]][[Lore of Fire]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore metal.png|38px]][[Lore of Metal]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore tzeentch.png|38px]][[Lore of Tzeentch]]

When equipped with specific items, [[Kairos Fateweaver]] has access to spells from another six lores of magic:

*[[File:Icon wh main lore beasts.png|38px]][[Lore of Beasts]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore death.png|38px]][[Lore of Death]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore heavens.png|38px]][[Lore of Heavens]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore life.png|38px]][[Lore of Life]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore light.png|38px]][[Lore of Light]]
*[[File:Icon wh main lore shadow.png|38px]][[Lore of Shadows]]

In addition, both [[The Changeling]] and [[The Blue Scribes]] have special abilities/mechanics that allows them to use spells from lores of magic not available to Tzeentch. This makes Tzeentch one of the few races that can use all lores of magic in the game.

=== Winds of magic manipulation ===
Another ability unique to Tzeentch is his specific control of the winds of magic. Indeed, so tied are his machinations to them that many buildings have unique effects when the winds of magic are particularly strong, increasing their capabilities. To this end, Tzeentch can reduce the winds of magic in one province where he has a settlement to increase it in another, at will. 

As well as providing the aforementioned buffs to his buildings, this allows for armies with multiple spellcasters – that’s going to be quite a lot of your Tzeentch armies, believe it or not – to benefit heavily in terms of the power reserves available to them. It’s also worth noting that there have been some large changes made to the nature of the Winds of Magic and power reserves in battle, which we will detail soon. The upshot is that this ability should never be discounted to ensure victory. 

=== Unholy Manifestations ===
[[Unholy Manifestations]] unlock as more corruption for your god is spread across the land.  The upgraded versions have heavier effects – generating more of a resource or dealing more damage to an army, for example. Here’s the Unholy Manifestations for Tzeentch: 

*Scriveners of Insanity 
**Unlocked from the start.
**Allows a friendly army to generate a big batch of grimoires over the course of several turns. The army cannot move during this time, and must be in enemy territory.
*Mutagenic Energies 
**Requires 1500 global Tzeentch corruption.
**Causes a target army to suffer attrition for a turn, regardless of situation or immunities.
*Magic Flare 
**Requires 3000 global Tzeentch corruption.
**Increases the Range and Barrier hit points of all units in an army. Barrier is a special shield all Tzeentch units have – we’ll detail this further in the upcoming roster reveal.
*Night of Madness 
**Requires 6000 global Tzeentch corruption.
**Target friendly army generates Tzeentch corruption and control (renamed from public order) loss in a province, as well as increasing the army’s Winds of Magic power reserve. It cannot move during these turns.

=== Cults ===
Cults can form once a god is particularly dominant in a region. This cult becomes a foreign building slot, owned by you, that can construct unique buildings based on your dedicated god. Tzeentch’s options are: 

*Sanctuary 
** Generates grimoires per turn.
*Repository 
**Generates more grimoires per turn but requires high winds of magic level.
*Sanctum 
**Generates a decent amount of income but also requires high winds of magic level.
* Campus 
**Destroys the cult but increases winds of magic here and in all adjacent to Tempestuous.

=== Teleportation ===
Unique to Tzeentch and unlocked through the tech tree, his armies can go into the Teleport stance. This costs Winds of Magic reserve power to adopt but is exceptionally powerful. Not only does it allow crossing of impassable terrain – say, mountain ranges, rivers, patrolled areas – but instantly triggers an ambush battle should you target an enemy army. It’s a one-shot move, so you must re-adopt the stance if you wish to go again on the next turn but getting to ambush armies as you like can really swing a war your way. This level of power is why it is locked in the later game for Tzeentch, requiring various techs to unlock.

== Trivia ==
*[[The Advisor]], the mysterious old man who guides the player, is an agent of Tzeentch.

== Strategy ==
Ranged attacks and Magic spells are the mainstays of Tzeentch's armies.  Melee units are not effective at dealing damage, and so mainly serve as chaff to hold enemy units in place while projectiles and spells output damage.  The Winds of Magic capacity and channeling rate for Tzeentch armies are higher than any other faction.  Army abilities charge up the more Winds of Magic is expended in casting spells during the course of the battle.   

All Tzeentch units have barriers that absorb damage from attacks before health points start to be depleted, and they will regenerate after not taking damage for a certain amount of time.  The more mobile units can take advantage of this by repeatedly  retreating to allow their barriers to regenerate before entering the fray again, thus prolonging their survivability.  The barriers are not affected by damage reduction, and thus will always take full damage from all sources.  In campaign, barriers are balanced by a lower than average health replenishment rate.

If you're not playing as Tzeentch, unless you want to do something, it's better to not to establish "contact" with any Tzeentch factions since they can just swap one of your settlements to another faction.
