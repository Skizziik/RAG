He is flux incarnate – the God who truly embodies the endless, broiling change that is Chaos. It is Tzeentch above all who holds the terrible knowledge of fate and destiny in his talons. His worshippers are desperate to share in such lore but are merely pawns in the Great Game; another piece to move on the board and outplay the other Chaos Gods. To serve Tzeentch is to invite insanity. His servants weave their own complex webs of influence and manipulation, founding cults in high society as well as armed legions of puppet-followers. They pay no mind to the fact that their master views such plots as mere petty distractions, for the Architect of Fate's own design is aeons in the making.",

Indeed, so tied are his machinations to them that many buildings have unique effects when the winds of magic are particularly strong, increasing their capabilities. To this end, Tzeentch can reduce the winds of magic in one province where he has a settlement to increase it in another, at will. As well as providing the aforementioned buffs to his buildings, this allows for armies with multiple spellcasters – that’s going to be quite a lot of your Tzeentch armies, believe it or not – to benefit heavily in terms of the power reserves available to them. It’s also worth noting that there have been some large changes made to the nature of the Winds of Magic and power reserves in battle, which we will detail soon.

The Winds of Magic capacity and channeling rate for Tzeentch armies are higher than any other faction. Army abilities charge up the more Winds of Magic is expended in casting spells during the course of the battle. All Tzeentch units have barriers that absorb damage from attacks before health points start to be depleted, and they will regenerate after not taking damage for a certain amount of time. The more mobile units can take advantage of this by repeatedly retreating to allow their barriers to regenerate before entering the fray again, thus prolonging their survivability. The barriers are not affected by damage reduction, and thus will always take full damage from all sources. In campaign, barriers are balanced by a lower than average health replenishment rate. If you're not playing as Tzeentch, unless you want to do something, it's better to not to establish \"contact\" with any Tzeentch factions since they can just swap one of your settlements to another faction.",
