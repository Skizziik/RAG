Slaanesh breaks minds and inflicts untold incredible suffering but also instills joy, creativity and extreme pleasure. Among mortals, Slaanesh appeals to the egotistical, the obsessive, addicts, artists, hedonists and other sensation-seekers. His followers are graceful, beautiful, cruel, sometimes with both masculine and feminine features. Slaanesh is said to desire Elven souls above all others, and devours them hungrily.",

From within the Realm of Chaos, the Dark Prince revels in each new sensation discovered. He guides the mortal inhabitants laden with desire to go ever futher in their pursuit of stimulation. Those who serve Slaanesh are consumed by their own dark passions, driven by the need for their mistress-master's approval to commit more sordid atrocities. And so Slaanesh's followers practice war upon the nations of the south, seducing their foes into service of their Dark God and inflicting symphonies of misery upon those who resist his call. * Devotees: Amass followers by raiding, sacking and looting settlements. * Summon Disciple Armies: Use Devotees to summon armies in corrupted areas. * Seduction: Compel enemy units to join your army during battles, and force whole factions into vassalage via your Seductive Influence.",

There does not appear to be a limitation on what kinds of units are vulnerable to Seduce Unit (unlike their campaign-based Seductive Influence ability which only works on certain races), but the cost varies by unit (in a manner analogous to their multiplayer cost) and the Slaanesh player will have both a maximum Seduce Units Budget they can spend and a maximum number of units they can affect.

Due to the importance of vassals for Slaaneshi factions, as well as the limitations of their Seductive Influence (see below), this would ordinarily make it quite difficult to continue making vassals after the midgame, as all the minor factions have already been gobbled up by majors. However, Create Vassal allows you to recreate a defeated minor faction as a Vassal when capturing a settlement that was previously their capital. It appears that this will also work on minor Chaos factions as well as Human and Elven factions, it is currently unknown whether it will work on other races (Ogres, Skaven, Dwarves, Lizardmen). Otherwise this ability yields the same rewards as the Subjugate post battle option, which is used to forcibly vassalize when defeating the last remaining settlement of a faction - notably, for Slaaneshi factions this provides a +500 Devotee boost as well as a small amount of replenishment.",

The size of the summoned army is equal to that of the summoning army plus 0-3 additional units (higher when the summoning army is smaller, lower as the summoning army approaches 20), the quality of the summoned army units is better in provinces with higher Slaanesh corruption (and appears to have no relationship to the tech levels present in the summoning army), and the level of the Herald leading the Disciple army matches that of the Lord of the summoning army. Disciple armies cannot replenish or have units transferred into them or out of them, cost their owner a small amount of Devotees per turn in upkeep (but no Divine Favor), and they take ongoing attrition inversely proportional to the amount of Slaanesh corruption in the province they occupy (with very high attrition in provinces with no Slaanesh corruption and no attrition in provinces with 100 Slaanesh corruption).
