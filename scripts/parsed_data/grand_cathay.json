      "content": "Grand Cathay is the largest empire in the Warhammer Fantasy setting. Located in the Far East, Grand Cathay is bordered to the west by the Mountains of Mourn, to the east by the Far Sea, to the south by Khuresh and to the north by the Eastern Steppes and Chaos Wastes. Southwest, across the Mountains of Heaven, lies the land of Ind. Grand Cathay itself is a huge and diverse country, with desert in the west, mighty rivers and farmland in the center, great coastal cities in the east, and forested mountain foothills in the south. Grand Cathay is a powerful nation of order that stands against Chaos. However, they are also located far from other order-aligned nations, and tend to be somewhat isolationist. Contact and trade with the High Elves and human nations of the Old World has increased in recent times, but travel between east and west is still dangerous. Because of this isolation, Grand Cathay long ago constructed the Great Bastion, a huge fortification along their northern border which guards against incursions by Hobgoblins as well as marauding bands of Hung, Kurgan and other forces of Chaos. The rulers of Cathay are a family of immortal dragons who are powerful spellcasters, and can shapeshift into human form. In principle, Grand Cathay is ruled by the Celestial Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress, who are revered by the populace. In practice, these two spend most of their time in the Imperial Court, and leave governing of the empire to their sons and daughters. The common people of Cathay are humans, with smaller populations of Monkey-Warriors. In some Cathay's trading cities, there is populations of foreigners from Tilea, Estalia, The Empire and even High Elves and Dwarfs. The strongest of the sons and daughters of the Emperor and Empress is Miao Ying, the Storm Dragon, ruler of the Northern Provinces, who is charged with defending the Great Bastion and the city of Nan-Gau. There is also Zhao Ming, the Iron Dragon, ruler of the Western Provinces. He guards the city of Shang-Yang which is located in the Warpstone Desert, and the dangerous Ivory Road, which trade caravans travel west to reach the Old World. Their brother Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon, rules the Central Provinces from the city of Shang Wu, and serves his father's empire as its chief bureaucrat and Administrator of the Realm. There are also Yin-Yin the Sea Dragon who rules the Eastern Provinces, and Li Dao the Fire Dragon who rules the Southern Provinces. While the Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress command their subjects to live and work in harmony for the good of all, it is not always so. For in addition to external assaults by the Ogre Kingdoms, Greenskins, coastal Dark Elf raiders and forces of Chaos, Grand Cathay is also sometimes riven by internal rebellions, Chaos Cults and jealous competition between the dragon siblings. During one period where the Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress were mysteriously absent, the so-called \"Monkey King\" was for a time able to march on the capital and usurp the throne, before eventually being ousted and disappearing into the south. Despite these threats, the proud armies of Grand Cathay fight on. At their core are untold legions of soldiers, from Peasant Long Spearmen to highly-trained Celestial Dragon Guard. These are supported by Jade Warrior Crossbows, Crane Gunners, Grand Cannons shaped like great bronze dragons and flying Sky-junks. Perhaps the most feared are the Terracotta Sentinels - constructs that lie motionless for centuries as huge statues until, in times of great need, they are magically animated to fight in the defense of the Celestial Empire. In battle, these varying units work in harmony with one another, becoming a much more effective fighting force together than they would be individually.",

      "content": "As an empire, a people, and on the battlefield, Grand Cathay is about harmony. They are a defensively focused army, long standing against the tides of darkness that crash against their Great Bastion, over and over again across the centuries. Ranged and melee units receive buffs when in close proximity, their power boosted as the Yin and Yang that runs through every inhabitant of the empire works in concert. This gives them incredible ranged firepower and a stalwart, hardy front-line. They are slow-moving and easy to flank, but their flying machines, alchemists, and dragon sorcerers do much to make the army a formidable one. On the campaign map, Grand Cathay must use the incredible wealth of the Ivory Road to fund their war effort and defense of the Grand Bastion, the invincible walled fortress that borders the Chaos Wastes to their North. Defending it and launching assaults from it is a key part of their campaign and will make or break the fates of mortals. Cathay's harmony function is somewhat similar to Bretonnia's Peasant Economy, where the player must maintain a balance between two resources to maximise production and output without penalties.",
