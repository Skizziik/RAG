  "name": "Grand Cathay",
  "background": "Grand Cathay is the largest empire in the Warhammer Fantasy setting. Located in the Far East, Grand Cathay is bordered to the west by the Mountains of Mourn, to the east by the Far Sea, to the south by Khuresh and to the north by the Eastern Steppes and Chaos Wastes. Southwest, across the Mountains of Heaven, lies the land of Ind. Grand Cathay itself is a huge and diverse country, with desert in the west, mighty rivers and farmland in the center, great coastal cities in the east, and forested mountain foothills in the south. Grand Cathay is a powerful nation of order that stands against Chaos. However, they are also located far from other order-aligned nations, and tend to be somewhat isolationist. Contact and trade with the High Elves and human nations of the Old World has increased in recent times, but travel between east and west is still dangerous. Because of this isolation, Grand Cathay long ago constructed the Great Bastion, a huge fortification along their northern border which guards against incursions by Hobgoblins as well as marauding bands of Hung, Kurgan and other forces of Chaos. The rulers of Cathay are a family of immortal dragons who are powerful spellcasters, and can shapeshift into human form. In principle, Grand Cathay is ruled by the Celestial Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress, who are revered by the populace. In practice, these two spend most of their time in the Imperial Court, and leave governing of the empire to their sons and daughters. The common people of Cathay are humans, with smaller populations of Monkey-Warriors. In some Cathay's trading cities, there is populations of foreigners from Tilea, Estalia, The Empire and even High Elves and Dwarfs. The strongest of the sons and daughters of the Emperor and Empress is Miao Ying, the Storm Dragon, ruler of the Northern Provinces, who is charged with defending the Great Bastion and the city of Nan-Gau. There is also Zhao Ming, the Iron Dragon, ruler of the Western Provinces. He guards the city of Shang-Yang which is located in the Warpstone Desert, and the dangerous Ivory Road, which trade caravans travel west to reach the Old World. Their brother Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon, rules the Central Provinces from the city of Shang Wu, and serves his father's empire as its chief bureaucrat and Administrator of the Realm. There are also Yin-Yin the Sea Dragon who rules the Eastern Provinces, and Li Dao the Fire Dragon who rules the Southern Provinces. While the Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress command their subjects to live and work in harmony for the good of all, it is not always so. For in addition to external assaults by the Ogre Kingdoms, Greenskins, coastal Dark Elf raiders and forces of Chaos, Grand Cathay is also sometimes riven by internal rebellions, Chaos Cults and jealous competition between the dragon siblings. During one period where the Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress were mysteriously absent, the so-called \"Monkey King\" was for a time able to march on the capital and usurp the throne, before eventually being ousted and disappearing into the south. Despite these threats, the proud armies of Grand Cathay fight on. At their core are untold legions of soldiers, from Peasant Long Spearmen to highly-trained Celestial Dragon Guard. These are supported by Jade Warrior Crossbows, Crane Gunners, Grand Cannons shaped like great bronze dragons and flying Sky-junks. Perhaps the most feared are the Terracotta Sentinels - constructs that lie motionless for centuries as huge statues until, in times of great need, they are magically animated to fight in the defense of the Celestial Empire. In battle, these varying units work in harmony with one another, becoming a much more effective fighting force together than they would be individually.",
  "how_to_play": "*The Ivory Road: Cathayan factions can send trade caravans west along the Ivory Road to the Old World, to gain income. Caravans will also face dilemmas that might enhance their rewards or destroy them. *Wu-Xing Compass: Use the magical Wu-Xing Compass to direct the Winds of Magic across the land, providing faction-wide benefits. *Harmony: Each action taken pushes the Harmony meter towards either Yin or Yang. The greatest benefits are gained from keeping the meter balanced in the center. *The Great Bastion: This mighty fortification will come under attack, but building it up will confer great benefits. *Battle Harmony: In battle, each unit is aligned with either Yin or Yang, and gain buffs when near an opposite-aligned unit. *Grand Cathay unit roster: Legions of weaker, cheaper human troops backed up by a diverse roster of stronger elite troops, flying cavalry, monsters, and war machines/artillery. A defensive, less mobile army vulnerable to flanking.",
