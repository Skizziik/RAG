      "description": "Harmony Cathay's troops are divided into two categories, Yin and Yang. Yin units are typically ranged units while Yang are Melee focused. When a Yin and Yang unit are in close proximity the Yin units will get a reload buff and Yang units will get a Melee defense buff. As a result Cathay armies function best with a diverse and well supported formations that can make use of these buffs.",

      "description": "Cathay's casters have a unique ability to boost the damage output of spells based on the number of spellcasters in the army. Each spellcaster in the army excluding the first will boost the effects of Cathayan magic by 15% up to a maximum of a 100% boost. For example if you have a caster Lord and hero in the army the boost will be at 15%, meaning damage spells will hit 15% harder and buffs with have a 15% boost as well. Adding a third caster will increase this to 30%, four will increase it to 45%, and so on and so forth.",

      "description": "As an empire, a people, and on the battlefield, Grand Cathay is about harmony. They are a defensively focused army, long standing against the tides of darkness that crash against their Great Bastion, over and over again across the centuries. Ranged and melee units receive buffs when in close proximity, their power boosted as the Yin and Yang that runs through every inhabitant of the empire works in concert. This gives them incredible ranged firepower and a stalwart, hardy front-line. They are slow-moving and easy to flank, but their flying machines, alchemists, and dragon sorcerers do much to make the army a formidable one. On the campaign map, Grand Cathay must use the incredible wealth of the Ivory Road to fund their war effort and defense of the Grand Bastion, the invincible walled fortress that borders the Chaos Wastes to their North. Defending it and launching assaults from it is a key part of their campaign and will make or break the fates of mortals. Cathay's harmony function is somewhat similar to Bretonnia's Peasant Economy, where the player must maintain a balance between two resources to maximise production and output without penalties.",
