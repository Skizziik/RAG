Barrier is a special shield all Tzeentch units have – we’ll detail this further in the upcoming roster reveal. *Night of Madness **Requires 6000 global Tzeentch corruption. **Target friendly army generates Tzeentch corruption and control (renamed from public order) loss in a province, as well as increasing the army’s Winds of Magic power reserve.

This costs Winds of Magic reserve power to adopt but is exceptionally powerful. Not only does it allow crossing of impassable terrain – say, mountain ranges, rivers, patrolled areas – but instantly triggers an ambush battle should you target an enemy army. It’s a one-shot move, so you must re-adopt the stance if you wish to go again on the next turn but getting to ambush armies as you like can really swing a war your way. This level of power is why it is locked in the later game for Tzeentch, requiring various techs to unlock.",

      "description": "Ranged attacks and Magic spells are the mainstays of Tzeentch's armies. Melee units are not effective at dealing damage, and so mainly serve as chaff to hold enemy units in place while projectiles and spells output damage. The Winds of Magic capacity and channeling rate for Tzeentch armies are higher than any other faction. Army abilities charge up the more Winds of Magic is expended in casting spells during the course of the battle. All Tzeentch units have barriers that absorb damage from attacks before health points start to be depleted, and they will regenerate after not taking damage for a certain amount of time. The more mobile units can take advantage of this by repeatedly retreating to allow their barriers to regenerate before entering the fray again, thus prolonging their survivability. The barriers are not affected by damage reduction, and thus will always take full damage from all sources. In campaign, barriers are balanced by a lower than average health replenishment rate. If you're not playing as Tzeentch, unless you want to do something, it's better to not to establish \"contact\" with any Tzeentch factions since they can just swap one of your settlements to another faction.",
