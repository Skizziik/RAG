  "name": "Tzeentch",
  "background": "Tzeentch – the Changer of the Ways – is the Chaos God of magic, evolution, manipulation and trickery. He is flux incarnate – the God who truly embodies the endless, broiling change that is Chaos. It is Tzeentch above all who holds the terrible knowledge of fate and destiny in his talons. His worshippers are desperate to share in such lore but are merely pawns in the Great Game; another piece to move on the board and outplay the other Chaos Gods. To serve Tzeentch is to invite insanity. His servants weave their own complex webs of influence and manipulation, founding cults in high society as well as armed legions of puppet-followers. They pay no mind to the fact that their master views such plots as mere petty distractions, for the Architect of Fate's own design is aeons in the making.",
