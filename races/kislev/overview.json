  "background": "\"You look down on us and think we are little better than barbarians, but you should be glad we are, for without us here, the northern tribes would be dining on the flesh of your children in your burning homes. But for the courage that flows in our veins would your lands be theirs. Look down on us? You should get on your knees and thank us every day!\" : â€”Vitalia Kovash, Kislevite Winged Lancerhttps://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Kislev The Kingdom of Kislev, sometimes known as the Realm of the Ice Queen, is the most northerly Human civilization within the Old World, a powerful and war-driven nation that is known far and wide for having some of the greatest horsemen to ever roam the plains of the southern realms. From the Worlds Edge Mountains to the East and the Sea of Claws in the West, Kislev stands at the very frontiers of Human civilization. Lonely villages stand isolated in the empty wilderness, while 3 mighty cities (Kislev, Erengrad, and Praag) rise from the landscape like great islands of stone. Kislev is a land covered in wide-open steppes, deep taiga forest, and thundering icy rivers. In the south, the climate is somewhat milder, allowing wide-scale farming, although winters are still bitterly cold. Heading north, Kislev becomes increasingly cold and barren, before ending somewhere in the marshy tundra of Troll Country. Overall, the climate is harsh and unforgiving, winters are long and dark. Only the strongest, most determined people can survive here. The inhabitants of Kislev are these very same people, a race of wolf-tough and self-reliant warriors, valiant and determined in the defense of their homeland against the hated marauders of the uppermost North. Ruled by a mighty Tzar, Kislev is a nation born from the saddle, the ancestry of the the country's two main ethnic groups (Gospodars, who are more common in the south and in cities, and Ungols who are more common on the frontiers) can both be traced to the mighty horse-warriors of the Eastern Steppes many millennia ago. Since the founding of this mighty kingdom, Kislev has been under siege by the murderous Hordes of Chaos. It is a kingdom that sits forever at the brink of total annihilation. Countless generations of Kislevites have fought, bled, and died in the snowy tundra of those harsh northern lands, and it is thanks to these brave Kislevite warriors that the Kingdoms of Men have managed to flourish in the south, huddled together in their warm and safe homes, whilst the Sons of Kislev fight till they draw their last dying breath. The land of Kislev bears a unique magic not found anywhere else in the world: Ice Magic, also known as the Lore of Ice. This incredibly dangerous and deadly magic flows throughout the entire region, and its power is at its strongest inside its borders and in cold weather. The Kislevites are a superstitious and deeply religious folk. Above all, they revere the bear-god Ursun (lord of winter, courage and strength, guardian of Kislev) and seem to have a special affinity with bears. Other important gods include Dazh (god of the sun, fire, summer, family and hospitality), Salyak (goddess of healing and comfort), and Tor (warrior-god of storms and vengeance). They also respect Ulric (god of wolves, winter and battle, primarily worshipped in the Empire) as kin to Ursun. Kislevites generally view southerners (eg: people of the Empire, Bretonnians) as soft and lazy, while southerners in turn view Kislevites as uncivilised and stern. Despite this, Kislev retains friendly relations with The Empire and Dwarfs: allies in the eternal fight against Chaos.",
  "how_to_play": "* Devotion, a unique resource to Kislevite factions, is gained by winning battles against Chaos armies and constructing certain buildings. If Devotion gets too low, such as by attacking other Kislevite factions, Chaos armies will be more likely to attack you. Devotion is primarily spent on performing one of four rituals to the Motherland, which provide powerful bonuses and invoke the four main Kislev dieties: Salyak, Dazh, Ursun and Tor. Devotion is also spent to construct some higher tier buildings. * The Ice Court and the Great Orthodoxy compete for Supporters, a second unique resource for Kislevite factions. The more Supporters your faction gains, the more likely will minor Kislevite factions want to confederate with you. Gold and Devotion can also be spent to limit the rival Kislevite faction's Supporters. For the Ursun Revivalists, Supporters can earn closer relations with the other two big factions, along with bonuses, and they add Supporters to the Ice Court. * Atamans are unique lords who do not earn XP, but gain traits through dilemmas that enhance the current region and/or army they are located in. Only one Ataman can be recruited for every two provinces under your control, and he can be recruited for free to lead your armies into battle. If the Ataman is killed, a new Ataman will have to be recruited. * The Ice Court (mechanic) means that Ice Witches and Frost Maidens take a long time to train, but are then recruited for a discounted price, at a higher level, and already with abilities/traits. * Most Kislev units are hybrid units, proficient in both ranged and melee combat. Most human Kislev units have the By Our Blood ability which makes them temporarily unbreakable when their leadership is low, allowing them to fight longer.",
