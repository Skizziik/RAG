  "name": "Slaanesh",
  "background": "The Dark Prince, the Prince of Excess/Pleasure, She-Who-Thirsts, The Serpent Slaanesh is the youngest of the Chaos Gods, and generally considered the weakest. He represents desire, pleasure, pain and excess and is associated with the colours pink, purple, gold, pale white and black. Slaanesh breaks minds and inflicts untold incredible suffering but also instills joy, creativity and extreme pleasure. Among mortals, Slaanesh appeals to the egotistical, the obsessive, addicts, artists, hedonists and other sensation-seekers. His followers are graceful, beautiful, cruel, sometimes with both masculine and feminine features. Slaanesh is said to desire Elven souls above all others, and devours them hungrily.",
  "how_to_play": "* The fastest, the deadliest - the most naked. Slaanesh is the fastest army in the game and does stunning amounts of damage in close quarters, to make up for the fact they have almost no ranged units and very little armor. *Slaanesh is the only Chaos daemonic faction that does not have a major diplomatic aversion penalty with other non-Chaos races. *Use Seductive Influence to turn non-Chaos races into your submissive vassals. *Draw Devotees to you with your hedonistic exploits and then commit them to spreading cults or Pleasurable Acts. *Spread Slaanesh Corruption. Summon disciple armies to fight for you in areas high in it. *Spend Divine Favour to seduce enemy units to fight for you instead.",
