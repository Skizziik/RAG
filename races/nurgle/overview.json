  "background": "The Lord of Decay, Grandfather Nurgle, The Crow Nurgle represents despair, resilience, resignation and acceptance ... in the face of inevitable disease, decay, death and entropy. Among mortals, Nurgle appeals to the downtrodden and hopeless. Nurgle appears to be the only Chaos God that has any sort of genuine care for his followers, offering them respite from pain and suffering caused by disease and death. His followers are often cheery and unconcerned even while visibly rotting, bloated or infested by maggots. They delight in spreading Nurgle's gifts (horrifying diseases which cause immense suffering) to others. Nurgle despises the undead, who resist the inevitable end of life. Nurgle is associated with the colours green and brown, flies, maggots, slugs, snails, toads and carrion-eaters. Among the Norscans, he is known as the Crow.",
