Located in the Far East, Grand Cathay is bordered to the west by the Mountains of Mourn, to the east by the Far Sea, to the south by Khuresh and to the north by the Eastern Steppes and Chaos Wastes. Southwest, across the Mountains of Heaven, lies the land of Ind. Grand Cathay itself is a huge and diverse country, with desert in the west, mighty rivers and farmland in the center, great coastal cities in the east, and forested mountain foothills in the south. Grand Cathay is a powerful nation of order that stands against Chaos. However, they are also located far from other order-aligned nations, and tend to be somewhat isolationist. Contact and trade with the High Elves and human nations of the Old World has increased in recent times, but travel between east and west is still dangerous. Because of this isolation, Grand Cathay long ago constructed the Great Bastion, a huge fortification along their northern border which guards against incursions by Hobgoblins as well as marauding bands of Hung, Kurgan and other forces of Chaos. The rulers of Cathay are a family of immortal dragons who are powerful spellcasters, and can shapeshift into human form. In principle, Grand Cathay is ruled by the Celestial Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress, who are revered by the populace. In practice, these two spend most of their time in the Imperial Court, and leave governing of the empire to their sons and daughters. The common people of Cathay are humans, with smaller populations of Monkey-Warriors. In some Cathay's trading cities, there is populations of foreigners from Tilea, Estalia, The Empire and even High Elves and Dwarfs.",

There is also Zhao Ming, the Iron Dragon, ruler of the Western Provinces. He guards the city of Shang-Yang which is located in the Warpstone Desert, and the dangerous Ivory Road, which trade caravans travel west to reach the Old World. Their brother Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon, rules the Central Provinces from the city of Shang Wu, and serves his father's empire as its chief bureaucrat and Administrator of the Realm. There are also Yin-Yin the Sea Dragon who rules the Eastern Provinces, and Li Dao the Fire Dragon who rules the Southern Provinces. While the Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress command their subjects to live and work in harmony for the good of all, it is not always so. For in addition to external assaults by the Ogre Kingdoms, Greenskins, coastal Dark Elf raiders and forces of Chaos, Grand Cathay is also sometimes riven by internal rebellions, Chaos Cults and jealous competition between the dragon siblings. During one period where the Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress were mysteriously absent, the so-called \"Monkey King\" was for a time able to march on the capital and usurp the throne, before eventually being ousted and disappearing into the south. Despite these threats, the proud armies of Grand Cathay fight on. At their core are untold legions of soldiers, from Peasant Long Spearmen to highly-trained Celestial Dragon Guard. These are supported by Jade Warrior Crossbows, Crane Gunners, Grand Cannons shaped like great bronze dragons and flying Sky-junks. Perhaps the most feared are the Terracotta Sentinels - constructs that lie motionless for centuries as huge statues until, in times of great need, they are magically animated to fight in the defense of the Celestial Empire. In battle, these varying units work in harmony with one another, becoming a much more effective fighting force together than they would be individually.",

From the Worlds Edge Mountains to the East and the Sea of Claws in the West, Kislev stands at the very frontiers of Human civilization. Lonely villages stand isolated in the empty wilderness, while 3 mighty cities (Kislev, Erengrad, and Praag) rise from the landscape like great islands of stone. Kislev is a land covered in wide-open steppes, deep taiga forest, and thundering icy rivers. In the south, the climate is somewhat milder, allowing wide-scale farming, although winters are still bitterly cold. Heading north, Kislev becomes increasingly cold and barren, before ending somewhere in the marshy tundra of Troll Country. Overall, the climate is harsh and unforgiving, winters are long and dark. Only the strongest, most determined people can survive here. The inhabitants of Kislev are these very same people, a race of wolf-tough and self-reliant warriors, valiant and determined in the defense of their homeland against the hated marauders of the uppermost North.",

Since the founding of this mighty kingdom, Kislev has been under siege by the murderous Hordes of Chaos. It is a kingdom that sits forever at the brink of total annihilation. Countless generations of Kislevites have fought, bled, and died in the snowy tundra of those harsh northern lands, and it is thanks to these brave Kislevite warriors that the Kingdoms of Men have managed to flourish in the south, huddled together in their warm and safe homes, whilst the Sons of Kislev fight till they draw their last dying breath. The land of Kislev bears a unique magic not found anywhere else in the world: Ice Magic, also known as the Lore of Ice. This incredibly dangerous and deadly magic flows throughout the entire region, and its power is at its strongest inside its borders and in cold weather. The Kislevites are a superstitious and deeply religious folk. Above all, they revere the bear-god Ursun (lord of winter, courage and strength, guardian of Kislev) and seem to have a special affinity with bears. Other important gods include Dazh (god of the sun, fire, summer, family and hospitality), Salyak (goddess of healing and comfort), and Tor (warrior-god of storms and vengeance). They also respect Ulric (god of wolves, winter and battle, primarily worshipped in the Empire) as kin to Ursun. Kislevites generally view southerners (eg: people of the Empire, Bretonnians) as soft and lazy, while southerners in turn view Kislevites as uncivilised and stern. Despite this, Kislev retains friendly relations with The Empire and Dwarfs: allies in the eternal fight against Chaos.",

If the Ataman is killed, a new Ataman will have to be recruited.\n- The Ice Court (mechanic) means that Ice Witches and Frost Maidens take a long time to train, but are then recruited for a discounted price, at a higher level, and already with abilities/traits.\n- Most Kislev units are hybrid units, proficient in both ranged and melee combat. Most human Kislev units have the By Our Blood ability which makes them temporarily unbreakable when their leadership is low, allowing them to fight longer.",

There are no labourers building great monuments to their gods, no scribes researching their latest magical obsession, not even the gruesome fighting pits of a Khornate bloodbath disguising itself as a town or city. Grandfather’s people need not gather to worship nor prove themselves with acts of devotion – he runs through their blood, after all. No, settlements infected by Nurgle are closer to growths that blight the landscape than real towns. Fields of rotting flowers, mushrooms and creeping vines – and at the center of it all, a great tree pulsing with life, death, and infection. In this manner, Nurgle buildings are not upgraded, they grow, flourish, die, and are reborn. Each building will evolve to its next phase over a number of turns, eventually withering and starting again from a base state. At each point its effects will be different, and each new evolution will add units to the recruitment pool – which we’ll come on to in a second. Say you choose a building slot to house a Rancid Aloe. After a few turns of building, it will complete and add a Forsaken of Nurgle unit to your pool, the secretions from the plant having been used to fuse metal and flesh in a manner pleasing to Grandfather. It will then begin to pollinate, and four turns later enter the germination phase. This increases the income the building generates and adds another unit of Forsaken to your pool. Another four turns, another boost in income, and this time a Spawn of Nurgle. This is true of all Nurgle buildings, be they for infrastructure or provide units. Indeed, many do both, spewing Nurglings as a byproduct even as their primary purpose is to support the region by infecting the Earth itself, increasing Control. In addition, various buildings, technologies, plagues, and so on can decrease the time between each phase, making the production of units quicker.",

    "text": "General Mechanic: Nurgle technology tree\n\nNurgle’s tech tree has similarities with Khorne, brothers in destruction as they are, with several pods of seven technologies each, requiring four to be researched to move on to the next. This gives you a lot of options on how you want to progress and what to unlock first, as well as how important moving on to the next pod is versus picking up a particularly useful tech. As well as the normal unit upgrades, diplomacy, and such forth, several Nurgle techs improve plagues in various ways, including unlocking new symptoms. Ironically similar to his major rival, Tzeentch, there are also several techs that add spells to Great Unclean Ones, making them powerful casters as well as oozing piles of rot. On the note of spells and magical abilities, Nurgle has access to various army abilities. These are unlocked through technology and are charged in-battle based on how much damage your units are taking. Each also has the Chain property, meaning that it will target a specific unit then spread to nearby units, rather than targeting an area. This can be powerful or a drawback, depending on how you use it, but certainly fits the theme of contagions spreading through both armies in real time. Also of note is the big variation between research times depending on the strength of various techs. Moving between each pod could take a significantly different amount of time depending on which techs you go for. Experiment! Such is the joy of Nurgle.",

    "text": "Background:\n\nIn ancient times, the Ogres were forced to abandon their homelands in the Far East, after a comet impact created the Great Maw and turned their home into a corrupted desert. After a Great Migration westwards, they destroyed the civilisation of the Sky-Titans, scattering the survivors who went on to become the Giants of today. The Ogres eventually settled in the Mountains of Mourn, establishing the Ogre Kingdoms. The Kingdoms are inhabited mostly by the namesake Ogres, a race of large humanoids, and Gnoblars, a small type of Greenskin. Ogres are tall and broad, easily the size of a , and much larger than a man or elf. They are violent, tough, always hungry, and typically more intelligent than Greenskins (though not by much). Gnoblars are small and cowardly, being even more pathetic than their Goblin cousins, but vicious and large in number. They serve the Ogres as slaves, and often snacks. Ogre culture revolves mostly around eating and violence, and cannibalism is common and accepted. Their primary god, The Great Maw, is a cruel deity of unending hunger and is worshipped with great bloody feasts overseen by Slaughtermasters - Ogres who are part cook, part wizard, and part priest. A secondary god is the Fire Mouth, a volcano worshipped by the Firebellies. Each Ogre Kingdom is ruled by a Tyrant, whose domain extends as far as he can see in the valleys of the Mountains of Mourn. The current Overtyrant of the Ogre Kingdoms is Greasus Goldtooth, a particularly canny and obese Ogre who has managed to convince most other Ogres that gold is as valuable as food. Greasus extracts tribute from trade caravans on the Ivory Road, and has become incredibly wealthy as a result. Ogres also have a great wanderlust, and Ogre mercenaries, known as Maneaters, can be found in camps across the world. Ogres are pragmatic and unscrupulous, they will work for anyone who can pay in gold, or, preferably, in food. Should payments stop they will immediately depart or, in some cases, eat their former employers. The Ogre Kingdoms are unique in that most units in their army are monstrous infantry (such as the Ogres themselves, and Yhetees), though they are also accompanied by various beasts of the mountains such as Rhinoxen and Sabretusks, and of course Gnoblars.",

There does not appear to be a limitation on what kinds of units are vulnerable to Seduce Unit (unlike their campaign-based Seductive Influence ability which only works on certain races), but the cost varies by unit (in a manner analogous to their multiplayer cost) and the Slaanesh player will have both a maximum Seduce Units Budget they can spend and a maximum number of units they can affect. These numbers will improve over the course of the game with technology upgrades, character skills, and buildings, as well as a particular Unholy Manifestation.",

He is flux incarnate – the God who truly embodies the endless, broiling change that is Chaos. It is Tzeentch above all who holds the terrible knowledge of fate and destiny in his talons. His worshippers are desperate to share in such lore but are merely pawns in the Great Game; another piece to move on the board and outplay the other Chaos Gods. To serve Tzeentch is to invite insanity. His servants weave their own complex webs of influence and manipulation, founding cults in high society as well as armed legions of puppet-followers. They pay no mind to the fact that their master views such plots as mere petty distractions, for the Architect of Fate's own design is aeons in the making.",

Indeed, so tied are his machinations to them that many buildings have unique effects when the winds of magic are particularly strong, increasing their capabilities. To this end, Tzeentch can reduce the winds of magic in one province where he has a settlement to increase it in another, at will. As well as providing the aforementioned buffs to his buildings, this allows for armies with multiple spellcasters – that’s going to be quite a lot of your Tzeentch armies, believe it or not – to benefit heavily in terms of the power reserves available to them. It’s also worth noting that there have been some large changes made to the nature of the Winds of Magic and power reserves in battle, which we will detail soon. The upshot is that this ability should never be discounted to ensure victory.",
